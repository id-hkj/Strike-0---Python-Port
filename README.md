The installer/exacutable file of the project will only be updated when there is a new version released of this port. You can access the past versions at https://github.com/id-hkj/Strike-0---Python-Port/releases  The python file may be updated any time. Generally, I'll make the new releases on Sundays, as that's when I have the most time.

THIS PORT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU WANT A MORE PLAYABLE VERSION OF THE GAME, GO TO scratch.mit.edu/users/id-hkj, AND FIND THE PROJECT TITLED 'STRIKE 0'

For this game, I am using the Pygame module, so if you would like to play it, you'll need to install pyame.
Steps for this are simple - make sure your python indtallation included pip
                            If so, in the terminal, type "pip install -U pygame --user"
                            Then you should be good to go!

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
  You can either download the exacutable with the sprites, or simply run the installer. I reccomend opening up the installer as admin at the begining, otherwise it doesn't do anything for a while after begginng installation.
  
  One thing to note when using the installer is that IT ONLY INSTALLS THE SPRITES AND APPLICATION - NOT THE SOURCE CODE.
  In the past, you hadn't been able to run this without it being in the correct location - now this is fixed!
