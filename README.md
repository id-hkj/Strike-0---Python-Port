THIS PORT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU WANT A MORE PLAYABLE VERSION OF THE GAME, GO TO scratch.mit.edu/users/id-hkj, AND FIND THE PROJECT TITLED 'STRIKE 0'

For this game, I am using the Pygame module, so if you would like to play it, you'll need to install pyame.
Steps for this are simple - make sure your python indtallation included pip
                            If so, in the terminal, type "pip install -U pygame --user"
                            Then you should be good to go!

IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO OPEN IT, PUT THE FOLDER TITLED 'Strike 0' IN THE C:\Program Files FOLDER. IF IT ISN'T THERE, THE PROGRAM WON'T WORK!
That's all that really needs to be said as of now. There are 2 things I'll do shortly after writing this:
  1. Use Pyinstaller to create a .exe file for it (On creation, instruction will be below)
  2. Create an installer for it.
