IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I LAST UPDATED THIS!

Soon I'll create a new installer for this.

THIS PORT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU WANT A MORE PLAYABLE VERSION OF THE GAME, GO TO scratch.mit.edu/users/id-hkj, AND FIND THE PROJECT TITLED 'STRIKE 0'

For this game, I am using 2 libaries: Pygame and Numpy. If you would like to play it, you'll need to install both libraries.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
  You can either download the exacutable with the sprites, or simply run the installer. I reccomend opening up the installer as admin at the begining, otherwise it doesn't do anything for a while after begginng installation.
  
One thing to note when using the installer is that IT ONLY INSTALLS THE SPRITES AND APPLICATION - NOT THE SOURCE CODE.
In the past, you hadn't been able to run this without it being in the correct location - now this is fixed!

I'll also test it properly soon.

It has been a while since I last worked on this, and I'm sorry for that.
