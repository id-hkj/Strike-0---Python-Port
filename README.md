THIS PORT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU WANT A MORE PLAYABLE VERSION OF THE GAME, GO TO scratch.mit.edu/users/id-hkj, AND FIND THE PROJECT TITLED 'STRIKE 0'

For this game, I am using the Pygame module, so if you would like to play it, you'll need to install pyame.
Steps for this are simple - make sure your python indtallation included pip
                            If so, in the terminal, type "pip install -U pygame --user"
                            Then you should be good to go!

IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO OPEN IT, PUT THE FOLDER TITLED "Strike 0" IN THE "C:\Program Files (x86)" FOLDER. IF IT ISN'T THERE, THE PROGRAM WON'T WORK!
