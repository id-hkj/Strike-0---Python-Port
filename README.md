THIS PORT IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU WANT A MORE PLAYABLE VERSION OF THE GAME, GO TO scratch.mit.edu/users/id-hkj, AND FIND THE PROJECT TITLED 'STRIKE 0'

For this game, I am using the Pygame module, so if you would like to play it, you'll need to install pyame.
Steps for this are simple - make sure your python indtallation included pip
                            If so, in the terminal, type "pip install -U pygame --user"
                            Then you should be good to go!

IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO OPEN IT, PUT THE FOLDER TITLED "Strike 0" IN THE "C:\Program Files (x86)" FOLDER. IF IT ISN'T THERE, THE PROGRAM WON'T WORK!

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
  If you want to install it, Download 'Strike-0-Installer.exe' and run it. I haven't figured out how to automate making a desktop/start menu shortcut, but this should do for now.
  To run it go to the following path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Strike 0\Strike 0.exe". I used NSIS to create the installer.
  INSTALLING IT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION WILL NOT WORK.
  
  One thing to note when using the installer is that IT ONLY INSTALLS THE SPRITES AND APPLICATION - NOT THE SOURCE CODE.
